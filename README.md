# Presentation

An Infrastructure as a Service cloud computing platform.

The application is made of 4 microservices + the vm instance itself:

- vm-manager:
  Manages user projects, takes in user's VM configuration and sends it to an orchestrator and a data source.
  Maps VMs to their respective names, descriptions, projects, tags, users, regions, CPU counts, storage sizes and ram sizes.
- vm-orchestrator:
  Manages compute nodes. Takes in VM specs (only CPU count, RAM, storage size and region), a UUID and a token from vm-manager, finds a suitable compute node, and orders it to create and spin up the VM instance.
- cloud-data-source:
  Stores user's instance configuration.
  Receives a UUID and a hashed input from the vm-manager, and stores it. Sends back a token.
- compute-node:
  Installed on machines with free resources.
  Registers itself with the vm-orchestrator, and sends a heartbeat periodically.
  Takes in VM specs (CPU counts, RAM, storage size) a UUID and a token.
  Creates an XML description of the VM instance which is then handled by libvirt.
  The XML config contains an encoded url to the cloud-data-source with the instance's predefined UUID and the token passed down by the vm-orchestrator.
- vm-instance:
  Once spun up, leverages the "cloud-init" method for fetching the user's configuration.
  Ideally, the image used is a preinstalled distribution with an additional configuration to "cloud-init" where you implement how the mechanism would contact the cloud data source, how to authenticate, how to take in the data and pre-process it (decrypt, parse, etc...).
  For simplicity, I opted in building a "dumb" implementation of this part (no hashing of data, no fancy auth method - auth uses a forever valid token for each instance).
